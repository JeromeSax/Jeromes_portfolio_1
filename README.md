Jerome's Portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio built using React, where creativity and technology come together. This portfolio showcases a diverse range of projects, each a reflection of my passion for software engineering, video game development, and musical exploration.

About Me
I am a dedicated software engineer with a flair for crafting dynamic webpages, innovative applications, and immersive video game experiences. Despite my recent entry into the tech world, I'm driven by a hunger for learning and a desire to merge creativity with code. Beyond programming, my journey as a multi-instrumentalist spans 19 years of saxophone mastery, which fuels my exploration of the intersections between music, technology, and gaming.

The fusion of music, technology, and creativity continues to fuel my endeavors.
